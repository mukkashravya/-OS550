1. My assignment conatins 3 files smukka1_assignment1.c, makefile and readme.textfiles
2. smukka1_assignment1.c has all the functionalities asked 
3. To compile that simply give make (compiles smukka1_assignment1.c and produces executable file named final)
4. To run the file simply give ./final

Steps to test my code:
1. By running ./output it gives you >sh550 as output
2. Give command ls, it gives output
3. For multiple arguments give ls -lrt, it gives output
4. For backgroung processes simply give sleep 10 & and the process goes into background 
5. we can generate multiple background processes with the step 4
6. By entering listjobs command, it will list all the background processes and their status
7. To bringback a process to foreground just enter fg and pid listed in step 6, shell brings back the background process and waits for it to complete
